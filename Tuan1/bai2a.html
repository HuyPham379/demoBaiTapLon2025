        <h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>
        <p>
          The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century,
          <strong>Leonhard Euler</strong> was born in Basel, Switzerland. There,
          he studied under another giant of mathematics,
          <strong>Jean Bernoulli</strong>. In 1731, Euler became a professor of
          physics and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler
          was the most prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over 800
          different books and papers. His influence was felt in physics and
          astronomy as well. Euler's work on mathematical analysis,
          <em>Introduction to analysis infinitiorum</em> (1748) remained a
          standard textbook for well over a century. For the princess of
          Anhalt-Dessau, he wrote
          <em>Lettres à une princesse d'Allemagne</em> (1768-1772), giving a
          clear non-technical outline of the main physical theories of the time.

          One can hardly do math without copying Euler. Notations still in use
          today, such as e and pi, were introduced in Euler's writings. He is
          perhaps best known for his research into mathematical analysis.

          trigonometry. From this equation, it's easy to derive the equation

          which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, π, e, and i in a single
          beautiful and elegant statement.

        <p>
          Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps
          unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.
